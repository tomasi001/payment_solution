# **Documentation from Discovery Workshops**

---

## **1. Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to outline the findings from the discovery workshops conducted for the development of an innovative restaurant application. This application allows diners to scan a QR code on restaurant tables to access a web-based menu, place orders, and make payments directly from their devices. The app integrates with existing restaurant POS systems to streamline order management and payment processing. A portion of each transaction is allocated to the application's bank account, while the majority goes directly to the restaurant. This document identifies areas needing work and provides responses to key workshop topics.
