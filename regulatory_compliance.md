## **1. Introduction**

As the Compliance Officer, this report outlines the regulatory and compliance requirements for the development and operation of a restaurant application that allows users to scan a QR code on a restaurant table to access a web app with the restaurant's menu, select items for purchase, and make payments. The app integrates with existing restaurant Point of Sale (POS) systems to upload orders and track table orders.
