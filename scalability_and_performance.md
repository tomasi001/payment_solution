# **Scalability and Performance Assessment for the QR Code-Based Restaurant Ordering and Payment Application**

## **Executive Summary**

This report assesses the scalability and performance requirements of the QR code-based restaurant ordering and payment application and proposes solutions to ensure the system can scale effectively. The application aims to enhance the dining experience by allowing customers to scan a QR code at their table to access the menu, place orders, and make payments through a web app. It integrates with existing restaurant POS systems and ensures a portion of the bill is directed to the application's bank account. As the user base and the number of participating restaurants grow, it is crucial to ensure that the system can handle increased load without compromising performance.
